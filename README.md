# Results files from the Secretary of State  
This is a collection of all of the results files that were posted by the Arizona Secretary of State on election night and on. The xml is completely unmodified. There might be duplicate files at times when my scraper had to force restart based on a connection issue. If you have questions find me at @garrett_archer on twitter.
